# Templates

Primitive example that shows the powerful of `gccx` javascript api. In this example we define a C++ file and a template file that cointains only `CPX`. Our script will combine them in the right way.

## How to use

Download this example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/mbasso/gccx).
After that install the dependencies and run the start command:

```bash
cd examples/templates
npm install
npm start
```

This will compile the source code under `src` folder and it will output in the `compiled` folder.
